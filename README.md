# Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation
 

In this project, a system needs to be developed to address the challenges associated with idiomatic language. The primary challenge is that some phrases can have multiple meanings, one that aligns with the literal interpretation of the words (e.g., a real rotten apple) and another that conveys a figurative meaning.
To tackle this, the algorithm's input will consist of a sentence containing a phrase that can be interpreted either literally or figuratively, along with three images and their corresponding captions. The algorithm should accurately understand the context and predict which image best represents the intended meaning of the phrase in the given sentence
